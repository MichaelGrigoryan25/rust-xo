# Rust ❌⭕

An imperfect tic-tac-toe game made completely with Rust as a learning project made completely from scratch.

## Getting Started

- Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MichaelGrigoryan25/rust-xo.git
cd rust-xo
```

- Run following commands

```bash
cargo build
cargo check
cargo run
```

## Playing the game

You are player `O`. You make a move after the computer(`X`).

After the computer has made a move your command line will look like this

```bash
CPU made a move
CPU HERE --> X | 1 | 2
             3 | 4 | 5
             6 | 7 | 8
___________________
Enter the number:  
0
```

Let's say that we want to move to the center. In that case we'll just enter

```bash
Enter the number:
4
```

And that's it!
